        <p>Welcome to the video experiment by the Motivated Memory Lab. If you would like to begin the experiment, please press the <strong>start button</strong> below. </p>
        <button id = "startButton" class = "button" @click = "startExp">Start</button>

            In this experiment you will be asked to watch several videos. Each video will begin with an empty canvas and will slowly reveal itself through one continuous line stroke.  Throughout the video, try to figure out what is being drawn. Record your answers in the space provided. Note that whenever you are typing your responses the video will pause briefly.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make the video resume playing you must <strong>PRESS ENTER</strong> to submit your guess and continue watching.
        </p>
        <p>
            When watching these videos please try your best to <strong>focus your attention on the drawing</strong> to give us the best understanding of how and when you can identify what it being drawn.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try to use the most common English words for drawing depictions. For example, if you see an image of a hamster write "hamster" instead of "animal" or "Winter White Dwarf hamster".
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Videos will start playing automatically when you hit the advance button (including the first start button).</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>To advance to the next video</strong>, you must first <u>type in your final guess and press enter</u> (only press enter once per "final guess") and <u>move both slider scales</u>. After these three things are done the <strong>"Next Video" button will appear at the bottom.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Depending on you browser and internet connection, sometimes a video will freeze for a handful of seconds. If this happens, please <strong>do not try to hit the Refresh button or move backwards in the task.</strong>
        </p>
