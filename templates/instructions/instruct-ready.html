        	Each video is between 15-30 seconds in length. While watching these videos we want you to document all the things you thought the drawing was going to turn into.
            Once you are sure of your answer, you will finish watching the rest of the video. After, you will answer some brief questions about the video and your experience.

            You will watch 20 videos in this task. We estimate that it will take between 20-25 minutes to complete.
